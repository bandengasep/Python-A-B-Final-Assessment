# Python-A-B-Final-Assessment
All of the assessment for Python classes in Graduate Diploma in Data Science (Applied) from Uni of Adelaide

For Python A, the project was to create an exploratory data analysis on a dataset taken from public sources. In that project, I chose to use the [Melbourne Housing Market dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/anthonypino/melbourne-housing-market) from Kaggle.

For Python B, the objective was to apply several regression machine learning models and chose the best one based on the lowest RMSE value. Why was this chosen, you asked? Well, because the assignment deemed it important, so there you go. The dataset is taken from the [UCI Machine Learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php), specifically the [real estate valuation dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Real+estate+valuation+data+set).
